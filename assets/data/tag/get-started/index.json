Since my blog was shutted down one/two years ago, I couldn't write posts because of different reasons: <strong>exams, lessons,</strong> so you got it. You can read my old posts <a href=\"https://catsblog.000webhostapp.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.\nAs always I love Linux, Web Development &#x26; English of course. That's why I'll try my best to impress my experience in the posts that I'll be writing. Except technical posts, maybe I also will tell about interesting events from my life, news.\nSo, be ready, soon here you'll get new I hope interesting posts for you. By the way, now I have portfolio website, there are some kinda projects of mine, about me, etc, so <a href=\"https://mrcat323.github.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">check out the link</a></p>\n"}}]}}},"context":{}}
